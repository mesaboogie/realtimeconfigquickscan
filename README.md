realtimeconfigquickscan_studioware
=======================

Linux configuration checker for systems to be used for real-time audio customized for use with Studioware.

This linux-only script inspects a linux installation, and makes suggestions for improving realtime/audio performance.

If you want to share the output of the script online, it is probably most convenient to use the Console version. If not, the GUI version might look a bit more friendly.
